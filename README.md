Advanced Geospatial Analysis Final - Fall 2016; NC Water Resources Interactive Map

Water Resources Map Neuse = Map of Water Resources within the Neuse river basin, centered on Durham, NC. USGS gages appear as green triangels, and streams are color
coded by their water quality status. Red for impaired, and blue for supporting. 

Water Resources Map Dropdown = Attempt to add a drop down selection menu that allowed the user to specify their watershed of interest. The tool would then query 
  the stream and gage data based on the user input.
  
Water Resources Map All Watersheds Labeled = Shows all North Carolina river basins highlighted and labeled. The user can then zoom in and explore water resources
   within their area of interest. Stream and gage layers show up at certain zoom (zoom = 9). 

Water Resources Map All Watersheds Hover = Shows all North Carolina river basins as grey undescript polgons. When the user hovers their mouse over a watershed it
is highlighted in purple, and the watersheds river basin name appears in the box on the top left corner of the screen. The user can then zoom in and explore water 
resources within their area of interest. Stream and gage layers show up at certain zoom (zoom = 9). Steams are no longer color coded by their water quality status
and the USGS icosn have changed from green triangle to blue default popups.
